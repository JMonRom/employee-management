  ## Description

  Using starter code I had to refactor it so that the application would properly write and save notes. The server.js file was missing that would connect the html to direct to Notes pages. When the user is redirected they should be able to append their new note title and note and refer back to it. After it is saved a new note should display for user input. 
  
  To do this I had to make a function that would make a new note and increase the count so a new note would be displayed. One challenge I came across was towards the end of the project because I kept getting an error loading the note on the page. However, after reviewing previous lectures I reviewed the use of fs module. Deploying to Heroku was also interesting to learn and was straightforward with the directions they provide.
