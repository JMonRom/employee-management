  ## Description

  This homework assigned me the task of creating an interface that lets non-developers manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  My first step was read through and review activities that used MYSQL, Inquirer and the console.table to navigate the app and allow for proper display of data and questions when prompted. I also looked for a different way to store my database credentials using dotenv. Then I started by creating my schema with the provided layout. The seeds file was created next to start populating some data for departments, roles, and employees. 

  Although a bit of a challenge was presented when trying to load the prompts but used the terminal to work out the issues that needed to be resolved. Often the appropriate parameters were not included and insuring I was properly spelling the functions and referring the correct ones where needed in the server.js. I also recieved some guidance from instructor in order to properly connect the db to display the information when called. Overall this project was useful to improve my knowledge of content management systems and how to effectively use MYSQL for database work.
